title: Week 2 - Code of Conduct Activity
---

Having a Code of Conduct document for a project has different benifits. It sets a standard for how contributors must act and resolve conflict in order to ensure the community behind the project is healthy. It lets potential contributors know that the people working on the project have values and that they care about their community - which can in turn encourage people to join.

Two Differences between the codes of conduct for the [Go project](https://go.dev/conduct) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/):

1. **Conflict Resolution:** Go encourages people to resolve conflicts directly, if possible and pushes for effective communication, while the Contributor Covenant says that individuals should report incidents to be handled by moderators.
2. **Enforcement:** Contributor Covenant states that those who do not follow or enforce the code may face repercussions, while Go does not.

An example of an organization using the Contributor Covenant is Eclipse, with their [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php). This CoC differs from that of the Contributor Covenant though because the Contributor Covenant is merely a template. It acts as the first step that companies, organizations, teams of communities can take to ratifying a set of rules to abide by, and then that company, org, team or community can modify it to fit them best.

The Ubuntu Code of Conduct is also adopted and modified by certain companies, such as Sugar Labs (as cited at the bottom of the page and visible through [the edit history](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct&action=history)). Sugar Labs's CoC focuses strongly on behavior over channels of communication, while Go's CoC speaks about people's behavior and how it may effect communities outside of Go. Additionally, the Sugar Labs CoC makes note of how community members should act when stepping down and relinquishing responsibility, something left out in the Go CoC. 

Further enforcing the popularity of the Contributor Covenant, [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), sponsored by Meta, also uses it. They officially adopted it in Issue #[16613](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16613). However, the React developers added this following sentence to the Scope section: 

```text
This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.
```

A similar approach Go's CoC, React's CoC appears to distance and protect sponsoring companies from any potential issues surrounding the developers of the project.
