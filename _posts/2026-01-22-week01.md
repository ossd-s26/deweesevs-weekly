## Thoughts

In a world of Software As A Service, it is easy to forget or never realize that things we use every day are open source. Here is some Open Source software I use on a daily basis:

Self-hosted tools:

- Immich
- PiHole
- VaultWarden
- Grafana
- Nextcloud
- Keycloak

Tools I use but don't host on my network:

- VSCode
- VIM
- Python
- Ubuntu
- Spek
- Homebrew
- WireGuard

There are more that I am either choosing to omit or am forgetting to add.

I want to contribute to projects that I use. So some of these are at the top of my list for what I may choose to work on this semester.

## Exploration of Open-Source projects

[R/selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-selfhosted) also has lots of projects. Their Wiki is expansive and has a massive [list of self-hosted, open-source projects](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-selfhosted) that could potentially be contributed to.
