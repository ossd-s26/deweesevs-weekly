## Exploration of Open-Source projects.

This week I got started by investigating [r/selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-selfhosted). Fortunately, their Wiki is expansive and has a massive [list of self-hosted, open-source projects](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#awesome-selfhosted).

In a world of Software As A Service, it is easy to forget or never realize that things we use every day are open source. Here is some Open Source software I use on a daily basis:

Self-hosted tools:
- Immich
- PiHole
- VaultWarden
- Grafana
- Nextcloud
- Keycloak
- 

Tools I use but don't host on my network:
- VSCode
- VIM
- Python
- Ubuntu
- Spek
- Homebrew
- WireGuard

There are more that I am either choosing to omit or am forgetting to add.
