# Hello!

This Jekyll blog was created for CSCI-UA 480, a course on Open Source Software Development, offered by New York University.

## About Me

My name is Ben. I am a student at NYU, majoring in Computer Science. I enjoy creating custom solutions for technical problems. [My work in the past](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deweesevs/details/projects/), through NYU's High Speed Research Network, personal projects and other internships, has allowed me to work on software and hardware, and I plan to continue on that path.

## Class & Blog Goals

This class will dedicate me time to work on open-source projects, and my goal is to contribute to those I find interesting.

As for this blog, it's purpose is to track my progress and allow for reflection on the work I complete over the 15-week semester.
